About The Repo of MileStone 2 and MileStone 1

The HEAD version of this project in folder FinalProject is MileStone 2.
You can roll back several version which contains comment “Commit of MileStone1 
adding game description.” Because as is indicated by one of TAs, the MileStone1 
should be the old version of MileStone2 in the same project with the name 
“FinalProject”. Sorry about that, so that is to say, originally we use another 
folder and if you want to have a double check, you can use the HEAD version of 
the project in folder FinalMileStone1 of jw84’s repo.

We already tried our best. We didn't beforehand know that we should put all the
codes into "FinalProject" folder.
