This project is done by Pei Chen pc30 and Jiawei Wu jw84.

The main file is in jw84_ym12_chatApp.controller.MainController (maintain this name because it is from HW08).

Now client side is equipped with an ability to send a panel which leads the other sides to open an window. this window's content is copyed from WWJ_Demo.
Currently the requirement is just to show that we can open such applications. Later on,
we will replace it with our game.


Guide:

When you launch the application from jw84_ym12_chatApp.controller.MainController.java, you can click on chatroom1, and then click on send map button on the upper right.
Then a new window will open, which displays a map, used for the game.
